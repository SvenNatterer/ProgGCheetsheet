# This exercise concerns itself with data in a certain format.
#
# You are advising the education board of a city on grading outcomes. They collect data
# on student's grades and need to put the data into different formats.
#
# The data they collect is a listing of students. For each student, they have a unique `student.id` (a random
# but unique character string which anonymizes the student's name), the student's `school`, and
# a `list` column `grades` containing named `numeric` elements indicating the grades which the student
# got during the last semester. The names are the subjects, and the values the grades ranging
# from 1 ("Very Good") to 6 ("Insufficient").
#
# An example dataset could look like the following. (See the notes in 02_exercise_sensordata.R
# on the format and other hints).
student.grade.data <- rbindlist(list(
    list(student.id = NULL, school = NULL,       grades = NULL),
    list("xzqk",            "North High School", list(c(maths = 2.0, physics = 1.3, chemistry = 1.7))),
    list("hffi",            "South Academy",     list(c(maths = 2.3, physics = 1.0, biology = 2.0, compsci = 1.0))),
    list("hwdp",            "South Academy",     list(c(maths = 3.3, chemistry = 3.0, biology = 2.7, compsci = 1.7))),
    list("flzb",            "North High School", list(c(maths = 1.7, physics = 2.0, chemistry = 2.0, biology = 2.0))),

# All your functions should `assertDataTable` the input value, but do not need to make any further assertions
# regarding the format of `data.table` arguments here.


# To be able to analyze the data better you should start by bringing them into "long format".
# You want a table that has the columns `student.id`, `school`, `subject`, and `grade`,
# where there are multiple lines for each student (one for each subject in which he or she was
# graded).
#
# Write a function that brings the input data into "long format". The function should have
# an argument `data` (a `data.table`) and return a `data.table` in long format.
# A possible result of the data above would be:
