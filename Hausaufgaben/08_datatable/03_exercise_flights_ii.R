# This exercise concerns itself with the *same* flight data as
# `03_exercise_flights_i.R`. Read the first paragraph in that R-file for more
# information about the format. Otherwise, these exercises are independent from
# the exercises in `03_exercise_flights_i.R` and can be solved on their own.


# Write a function that returns the rows of maximum delay, for each route.
# Input:
# - `flights`: `data.table` in the format of the example `flights.data` given
# Output:
# `data.table`: a subset of the `flights` input data, containing the rows
# that are the flights with the highest arrival delay for each route, in any
# order. If there are multiple rows in a route with delay equal to the maximum
# of that route, any single of these rows should be returned. No rows should be
# returned for a connection that was not serviced in the data.
# An example result for the `flights.data` would be

# You are doing market research on the profitability of restaurants and shops at

# Write a function that lists, for each month in the flights data in
# in chronological order, the number of flights that departed from a given
# airport during a given set of opening times.
# Input:
# - `flights`: a `data.table` in the format of the example `flights.data` given
# - `airport`: a `character(1)` indicating an airport of departure to consider.
# - `opening.times`: a `data.table` with columns `open`, `close`, with rows
#   indicating periods of time during which a given shop is open. Both columns
#   are integer numerics between 0 and 24 inclusive; a shop is open during
#   midnight if `close` is a number smaller or equal to `open`. An example input
#   for a shop that is open for flights leaving at 8, as well as for flights
#   that leave 14-17 and 20-3 (through midnight) would be (note that the upper
#   bounds are exclusive, since a shop that closes at 9:00 will not catch customers

#   You can rely on opening times never overlapping.

# `data.table`: a table with columns `year`, `month`, `count`, indicating the
# number of flights that left the given `airport` during the `opening.times`
# at each month in the dataset.
#
# If `airport` is not among the values in the `flights` `origin` column, then
# naturally the number should be 0 for all months occurring in `flights`.
#
# The dataset contains both `hour == 0` and `hour == 24` flights. These should
# be treated the same; i.e. a flight leaving at `hour == 24` should count for
# a shop open with `open == 0`.

# The result for the example flights data, as well as the `openings` example
# above for the departure airport `DEN` could be:
